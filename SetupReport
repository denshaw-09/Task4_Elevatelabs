Firewall Setup and Testing Report

Objective:

To configure, test, and verify firewall rules on Windows (Windows Defender Firewall) and Linux (UFW - Uncomplicated Firewall) to allow or block traffic.

ðŸ”¹ Windows Firewall Configuration (PowerShell & Netsh)

1. Check Existing Firewall Rules

To list firewall rules related to Telnet, run:

``` Get-NetFirewallRule | Where-Object { $_.DisplayName -like "*Telnet*" } ```

2. Block Telnet (Port 23) - PowerShell

Run in PowerShell (Administrator Mode):

```New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Block Telnet" -Direction Inbound -Action Block -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 23 ````

(If this command fails, ensure PowerShell is run as Administrator.)

3. Alternative Firewall Block (Using Netsh in CMD)

If the PowerShell command doesnâ€™t work, use the Netsh method:

```netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Block Telnet" dir=in action=block protocol=TCP localport=23``` 

4. Block Outbound Telnet Traffic

To block outgoing Telnet connections, run:

```netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Block Telnet" dir=out action=block protocol=TCP remoteport=23 ```

5. Verify Firewall Rules
Run:

```netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name="Block Telnet"``` 

(Ensure the rule appears with correct settings.)

6. Test if Telnet is Blocked

Try to connect using:

```telnet telehack.com 23``` 

â€¢	If the firewall is correctly configured, the connection should fail.

7. Remove Firewall Rule (If Needed)

To delete the Telnet block rule:

```netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="Block Telnet" ``` 

ðŸ”¹ Linux Firewall Configuration (UFW - Uncomplicated Firewall)

1. Install UFW (If Not Installed)
Run:

```sudo apt update && sudo apt install ufw -y ```

2. Check Current UFW Status

Run:
```sudo ufw status``` 

â€¢	If UFW is inactive, enable it:

```sudo ufw enable ```

3. Block Telnet (Port 23)
Run:

```sudo ufw deny 23/tcp ```

(This prevents Telnet connections on Linux.)

4. Allow Telnet (If Needed)
To permit Telnet connections, use:

```sudo ufw allow 23/tcp ```

5. Verify UFW Firewall Rules
Run:

```sudo ufw status numbered``` 

(This displays all active firewall rules.)

6. Delete Firewall Rule (If Needed)

Find the rule number using:

```sudo ufw status numbered ```

Then remove it using:

```sudo ufw delete [rule_number] ```

7. Test if Telnet is Blocked

Try:

```telnet telehack.com 23``` 

â€¢	If correctly configured, Telnet should fail to connect.
